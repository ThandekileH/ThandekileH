- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thandekile 
- 👀 I’m a motor mechanic by profession. But I have recenctly developed an interest in the field of Data Science after taking a short course in Financial Analysis, which actually introduced me to the field of Data Analytics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Fundamentals with IBM SkillsBuild and Data Analytics Essentials with Cisco Skills For All. Still in the foundational stage in the field.
- 💞️ I’m hoping that with further studying, practice and mentorship from the gurus in the field, I will eventually become a pro myself.
